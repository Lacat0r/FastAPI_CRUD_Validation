* First I created a list called BOOKS
* Validated the list inputs using BaseModel and Field
* Created a class that has a default configuration for the book
* Created , Read, Updated, and deleted books in the list using the CRUD Operations with taking care of the validations
* Created a function that fills the BOOK list if it was empty with different types of books of my creation
